## Creating and exporting assets 

### Unity Editor and project setup
* Download the Unity Editor version as specified [here](https://github.com/FoxyVoxel/going-medieval-modding/blob/main/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt)
    1. (Make sure you install Unity Windows Build Support)
* Clone [this](https://github.com/FoxyVoxel/going-medieval-modding.git) project
* Add project to Unity Hub and open it

### Making Your Asset Build
* After Unity loads, you should see the AddressableBuilder window. If not, you can open it manually from the “Going Medieval” menu at the top of the screen.
* Click the **Create New** button
* In the following popup give your mod a name and click **Create**

* You should be able to see your mod in the **Project Window**, including empty folders. It’s advised that you don’t edit this directory manually.

* Now, you can copy assets to the correct folders. 
    * .fbx files to **Mesh** 
    * Texture .png files to **Texture**
    * .png files used for UI to **Sprite**. For those, there’s an extra step. Set **Texture Type** to **Sprite (2D and UI)** and apply changes.
* Going Medieval uses **TMP Sprite Assets** to display icons in line with text. Open the “Going Medieval>TMP SpriteAsset Creator” window to create it. Select Mod Root Folder - in our example, that's “Assets/Mods/FVMod”; this selects all sprites from the **Sprite** folder.
* The window is now populated with a list. Modify the selection if needed and click **Create TMP SpriteAssets**.

* Back in the **AddressableBuilder** window, make sure your mod is selected and click on the **Create Addressables** button.

* Open **Addressable Groups** window (Window>Asset Management>Addressables>Groups), and you should see your newly created mod group set as  (Default) with all assets in it and with all labels correctly applied.

* Once again, in the **AddressableBuilder** window, check if your mod is selected and click on the **Build** button.
* After the build is done, asset packages should be placed in the mod’s **Exported** folder.  Copy its contents to your mod’s “Documents/Foxy Voxel/Going Medieval/Mods/Data/AddressableAssets/” and use the new assets in JSON files to show assets in the game. 

### Next steps
* To test addressable mods in game, download [Foxy Example Mod](https://github.com/FoxyVoxel/going-medieval-modding/blob/main/ExampleMod/Foxy%20Voxel%20Example.zip) and unzip it to **Mods** folder on your hard drive
* Now, with this mod enabled, you'll get fancy Foxy statue under **Misc** build menu
